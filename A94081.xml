            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is evident from hence that a <hi>Common-wealth</hi>

            <p>It is evident that ſuch a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is to be termed a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and an equall one, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> (with the diviſion ſpecified) was none, or elſe at leaſt it is not onely juſt but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall (for God perfectly ownes both thoſe attributes) to eſtabliſh an unequall one; une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall according to the ſeverall orders of men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall according to one, the <hi>Iſraelite.</hi>

But let any judge if it be more for the diſpraiſe of a Republike, that (without any further addition) it is ſaid, <hi>in thoſe dayes there was no King in Iſrael:</hi> then to Monarchy after, that <hi>in thoſe dayes reigned King David?</hi> or <hi>in thoſe dayes there was no King in Iſrael, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes:</hi> and afterwards, <hi>there ruled Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Another of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> arguments is, <hi>p.</hi> 90. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 82. <hi>Nothing more incident to corrupted nature than ſelf-love to blinde men, and every man to be partiall in his own cauſe: now it is the people that are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, judged, puniſhed, &amp;c. and therefore how likely are they by partiality to themſelves, to make the Government next to none?</hi> I anſwer that Mr. <hi>Baxter, p.</hi> 102. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 99. objecteth againſt a <hi>Democracy,</hi> that it is the worſt, becauſe it will exerciſe the greateſt cruelties; which though it be falſe, yet is a charge inconſiſtent with that of partiality. Secondly, this objection is either ill framed, or it is deſtructive to all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for in all Governments ſome muſt be
<pb facs="tcp:170449:24"/>Judges in their own Caſe, and this Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is non-ſenſe. The Queſtion is, whether ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arbitrary power, or a power to judge in ones own caſe muſt reſide ſomewhere, where then is it beſt fixed? I ſuppoſe in the people; and that it is as impoſſible for a <hi>Democracy</hi> to be partial, as for one upon a hundred Dice to caſt as <hi>many,</hi> or <hi>fifty one</hi> aces, which is a ſecurity infinitely greater than what Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> one Die will afford us. And this is ſecurity enough againſt what <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>p.</hi> 93. That <hi>the Laws cannot hold a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy from abrogating Chriſtianity.</hi> I anſwer, no, not if they will: but if it be once prevalent, you have a pretty good ſecurity <hi>[a moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility]</hi> that it ſhould ever be exterminated. What may happen under a Monarchy the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Japan,</hi> beſides the actings of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and others will teſtifie: but it is evident that no <hi>Common-wealth</hi> permits the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was much more eaſily planted in Common-wealths (for the <hi>Jewes</hi> after the Captivity, however they had the name of Kings ſometimes among them, were a kinde of one, or an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us:) and when but a few made up all Chriſtendome, with how much difficulty was our Saviour put to death.

Yet this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>private Spirit</hi> in the breaſt of a Saint, however it be ſo clear and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that his <hi>Faith</hi> becomes <hi>the</hi> very <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things hoped for,</hi> and <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 1. yet is it like unto the <hi>white ſtone,</hi> and <hi>the new name which no man knows but he that hath it, Revel.</hi> 2.17. it obligeth not others purely to a belief, who have not received the like ſatisfaction: What is <hi>Revelation</hi> to one, is but <hi>Tradition</hi> to another, and he who will believe every man that ſaith he is ſent of <hi>Heaven,</hi> may himſelf, (unleſs <hi>chance</hi> be as prevalent as <hi>choice</hi> in ſoul concerns) go himſelf to <hi>Hell.</hi> Thus <hi>Pilates</hi> wife was <hi>obliged</hi> to believe <hi>God</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>her. He</hi> was <hi>not bound</hi> to believe a <hi>woman</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>him. Have thou nothing to do with that juſt man, for I have ſuffered many things this day in a dream be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him.</hi> He might think, ſhe might be willing to deceive, out of a natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſtrong in that Sex; or might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her ſelf, calling that <hi>inſpiration,</hi> which was <hi>fancie.</hi>

            <p>This unſupplyable defect of common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the delivery of Spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is of that nature, as it alone would ſuffice to the enforceing a Toleration. For
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170449:47"/>though it be a confeſſed principle that whatſoever the prime verity doth ſay is an uncontroulable truth, yet the courſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he diſcovers himſelf, <hi>in divers wayes,</hi> and <hi>after divers manners</hi> unto the ſons of men, is followed with ſo much ambiguity, [waving that <hi>Soul-ſatisfying</hi> teſtimony of the Spirit,] as <hi>inquiſitive</hi> men, and <hi>ſober,</hi> if deſtitute of the higheſt gifts may upon a rationall ground (if that way of arguing unto which we are bred up be true and ſound) ſuſpect the ſincerity the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the word, and if he aſſent thereunto ſtrongly and firmely, he is rather to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted reſolved, then certaine. And it is judiciouſly ſaid,
<q>All voluntary opinion (that is grounded not in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but will onely) is vitious. A ſentence famous amongſt the old phyloſophers, and confirmed by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that to give a direct aſſent to what you know to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eertain, is <hi>Turpe,</hi> that is (in our ordinary locution) <hi>Sin</hi> in all propoſitions, where we ſee no more then probability, it is our part to withhold our aſſent, till evidence or certainty deſerve it. The reaſon is cleare, for if a man do ſtrain his ſtomack with meat or drink, his armes with pulling, or walks himſelf off on his feet, we blame him becauſe he uſes his body otherwiſe then is fitting, or out of proportion to his diſpoſitions, and therefore wrongs it, diſappointing the end and uſe to which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170449:48"/>nature deſigned it. Since then our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is our principall and moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part, farre leſſe ought it to be ſtrained againſt it's nature, and which encreaſes the unworthineſs of the Act, this cannot be done to the underſtanding, but by an inferiour, whoſe [end is good, not truth and ſo no fit motive for faith, and] to obey or be ruled by its dictates.</q> Nor is this any derogation; to God's word but a charge upon the weakneſs of man, not being able to comprehend things certain in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and evident to ſome, upon other accompts. I ſhall not debate this matter any further it having been learnedly and unanſwerably handled by Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Propheſying.</hi> I now come to ſhew that where there is wanting an infallible Expoſitor of the minde of God (which being to be accepted upon <hi>Revelation,</hi> is not to be diſcuſſed by <hi>Reaſon</hi>) there is not onely cauſe for a <hi>Toleration,</hi> (for why ſhould any be forced from what he holds to be true, <note place="margin">It is not <hi>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is not to be denyed that under <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> (as alſo now) in the ſame campe men of both religions fought for the ſame perſon, and that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants offered the Papiſts a Toleration; and adviſed their King to it, and thought it not only neceſſary, but lawfull, as again their King being turned <hi>Papiſt</hi> they ſued for a Toleration and procured that <hi>Edict,</hi> by the benefit whereof they enjoy their preſent Liberty.

            </p>
            <p>For the explanation of theſe texts I ſhall obſerve what is the opinion of the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbies,</hi> and what hath been the practiſe of that Nation. They divide the world into two parts, the ſons of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> to themſelves they ſay the Law promulgated in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; to the reſidue of man-kind whom they call the ſons of <hi>Noah,</hi> they ſay that they are not obliged to the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to ſeven precepts given to <hi>Noah,</hi> but whether ſuch precepts were actually given, or onely imprinted in the Souls of all men at their originall, is diſputed amongſt them: Hereby they are ſaid to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have abſtained from Idolatry; from blaſphemy, or curſing the holy name [of God] from murther, from adultery and inceſt, from theft, and that they ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Polity or Magiſtracy for the keeping inviolably theſe precepts. The laſt (which they ſuppoſe to have been given to <hi>Noah,</hi> as the former were even to <hi>Adam</hi>) that they ſhould not eat the members of any creature which had been cut off from it whileſt it was yet living. Theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements which they ſay were given to all man kind, and to the obſervation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were ſo obliged hereunto, that they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170449:79"/>could nor without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Yet however the Nations were obliged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, yet did God eſtabliſh no paramount judge over them, ſo that any true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or peculiar Nations or people ſhould have it in charge to prohibit, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them in their tranſgreſſions, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh their Idolls. This is clear from the account we have of things from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning unto the erecting of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh polity:</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> in his pilgrimage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Idolaters, and did not deſtroy them, or attempt it, or diſoblige them in diſcourſe or deportment; though what he might have done that way (eſpecially in conjunction with <hi>Melchizedech King of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>) be evident from his atchievements in the behalf of <hi>Lot</hi> againſt the four Kings. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. and from the reſpect paid him by the Sons of <hi>Heth</hi> (before whom he uſed much addreſſe, <hi>bowing himſelf</hi>) <hi>Hear us my Lord; thou art a mighty prince among us.</hi> or a Prince of <hi>God;</hi> things that excell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an <hi>Hebrarſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet that he vexed them, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked them by imbittering cenſures, &amp;c. I find no mention in ſacred writ. So <hi>Jacob</hi> lived with <hi>Laban</hi> an Idolater and marryed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170449:80"/>his daughter, being then, and continuing after an Idolatreſſe; yet did not he moleſt <hi>Laban</hi> in his worſhip; as may be gathered from the Text, for if <hi>Laban</hi> ſo fiercely purſued him for thoſe. <hi>Idols</hi> which <hi>Rachell</hi> had carried away; we may be certain that he would not have ſo friendly before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with him, if he had gone violently to demoliſh them. So the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and multiplying there, in a land full of Idolatry, I do not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conteſt emerging about their different worſhips. After that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that God modelled that people into a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> they had this law given them Exod. 22.20. <hi>He that ſacrificeth to any God ſave unto the Lord onely, he ſhall be utterly deſtroyed;</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Anathema:</hi> of which law the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not univerſall, but to be underſtood of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Jewes.</hi> For it was not ever extended to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> living ſeparate from the <hi>Jews;</hi> for the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were not hereby obliged to deſtroy all their Neighbours that were Idolaters, they never practiſed ſuch a thing, nor is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereof laid to their charge: They were to be left to the judgment of God, who in the event and finall iſſue would cut them off and deſtroy them. The Law in it's letter, and as farr as man had power to execute it, was limited to the ſeven Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which God had given to the Children
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170449:80"/>of <hi>Iſraell</hi> for a poſſeſſion: <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Theſe are the ſtatutes and the judgments which ye ſhall obſerve to do, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170449:81"/>thereunto, it was in like manner pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable for any <hi>Stranger</hi> to attempt the like.

            <p>But to give a punctual anſwer to theſe Laws: It is evident that they are part of the <hi>Political</hi> Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized

            <p>Much more might be ſaid of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and their puniſhment out of <hi>Austin.</hi> and how it is generally acknowledged how the Orthodox <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did never implore the aide of the Magiſtrate for 400.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, Seeing that of late years there have been ſeveral plots and deſigns againſt her Majeſties Perſon and Realm, and ſeveral hoſtile attempts have been made upon new pretenſes and purpoſes for the reſtoring again of the Catholick Religion by force of Arms, (a thing promoted in other parts of the World, but more particularly againſt the Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie and her dominions, then any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince) with which violent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and practiſes, her Majeſtie, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe gracious and milde in her behaviour towards her Subjects, being grievouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked againſt the Catholicks [who owning
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170449:95"/>and obeying the Apoſtolique Sea in the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Faith and Religion were eaſily ſuſpected to favour ſuch contrivances and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions) hath made more ſevere Lawes, and executed them more rigorouſly then She would otherwiſe, in caſe ſuch hoſtile attempts and warrs had not intervened.</hi> We, <hi>that we may approve unto her Majeſty our fidelity in this particular caſe,</hi> do ſincerely profeſſe, and by this our publique deed do notifie unto the whole Chriſtian World, that in caſe of Conſpiracies, and Plots againſt the life of Her Majeſty, of invaſions and hoſtile attempts made by any Forreign Prelate, Prince, or Potentate, either joyntly, or ſingly, for the diſturbance or deſtruction of her Majeſties perſon, or dominions upon deſign, or under pretence of reſtoring the Roman-Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> that we will defend her Majeſties Perſon, Realmes, and Dominions from all ſuch hoſtile at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and injuries: And we do further profeſs that we will diſcover and reveal, as well as oppoſe and reſiſt to our utmoſt endeavour, all Conſpiracies and Deſigns of any Prelate, Prince, or Potentate, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, which ſhall tend any way to the deſtruction of her Majeſties perſon and

                        <p>Thirdly, if after any ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication pronounced or to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt her Majeſty, or preceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly to any conſpiracy, invaſion or hoſtile attempt to be made, the Pope ſhould declare her Majeſties native ſubjects to be excommunicated, unleſſe they relinquiſh their allegiance and the defence of her; We in theſe and all ſuch like caſes profeſſe that neither we our ſelves, nor any Lay-Catholiques borne within her Majeſties dominions, ſhould be obliged in Conſcience by any ſuch cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo as to obey it. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Authority, or ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication pronounced or to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as aforeſaid, we will adhere unto and defend our Queen and Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as we are bound in duty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all due obedience unto her Majeſty in Temporalls.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly, becauſe it is certain, that whileſt we by a Chriſtian and ſincere profeſſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to her Majeſty our good affection and fidelity towards her, others will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170449:96"/>to condemn ſuch our deed, and miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, and create odium unto us in al places, but eſpecially with his holineſſe, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of our good names and perſons, unleſſe we timely prevent ſuch their miſreports: We humbly deſire that her Majeſty would be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as in this our recognition we render to her Grace what is due to Caeſar, ſo for the ſtopping the mouthes of all calumniators, we may have liberty in the like publique man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to declare, that whileſt we profeſſe due al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to her Majeſty, we do not intend to recede from that duty which we owe our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Spirituall Paſtor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wherefore we acknowledge and confeſſe that the Biſhop of Rome is the Succeſſour of S.</hi> Peter <hi>in that Sea, and that he hath not leſſe, nor yet more Authority and juriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, and all other Chriſtians, then the ſaid Apoſtle had enſtated on him by command and conceſſion of Chriſt our Saviour: and that we will obey his holineſſe as farr as we are bounden by the Law of God, which we doubt not but it may conſiſt very well with ſuch our obedience, a we have above profeſſed towards our Temporall Prince.
